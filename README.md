# A-sleep-tracking-app-for-a-better-night-s-rest
A project that demonstrates the use of Android Jetpack Compose to build a UI for a sleep tracking app. The app allows users to track their sleep.With the “Sleep Tracker” app, you can assess the quality of sleep they have had in a day.
When most people think about getting a good night’s rest, they think about the length of time they sleep. But so much more goes into a night of good-quality sleep than just eight straight hours.
Helping you understand the true quality of your sleep is where sleep trackers come in.
Sleep trackers keep tabs on a variety of biological metrics, delivering invaluable data that can help you 
better understand your sleep patterns, challenges, and areas of potential improvement — all of which you can use to get better, deeper rest, if you understand what you’re seeing.
